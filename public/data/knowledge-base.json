      "body": "## The Unstoppable March of Machine Capability\n\nHumanity has been automating labor for centuries. Each wave follows the same pattern: a new general-purpose technology emerges, disrupts existing work, causes social upheaval, and eventually creates new forms of prosperity — for those positioned to benefit.\n\nBut this time may be different. Not because the pattern has changed, but because the scope has.\n\n### The Agricultural Precedent\n\nTwo centuries ago, over 90% of the American workforce was employed in agriculture. Today, that figure is under 2%. The transition wasn't painless — it involved decades of displacement, migration, and social conflict. But it ultimately freed humanity to build an industrial civilization of unprecedented abundance.\n\nThe lesson isn't that \"new jobs always appear.\" The lesson is that automation fundamentally restructures society, and the outcomes depend entirely on how we manage the transition.\n\n### Manufacturing's Rise and Fall\n\nAmerican manufacturing employment peaked in 1979. In the decades since, total headcount has been cut roughly in half — yet output has *tripled*. That represents a 600% improvement in labor efficiency in just four and a half decades.\n\nThe jobs didn't simply \"move\" to services. They were automated away. And the pattern that swept through agriculture and manufacturing is now sweeping through the knowledge economy.\n\n### The Cognitive Frontier\n\nWhat makes the current wave of automation different is its target: cognitive work. Previous revolutions automated physical tasks — strength and dexterity. AI automates thinking, analysis, writing, coding, and creativity.\n\nDavid Shapiro's framework identifies four basic human economic offerings:\n\n1. **Strength** — largely automated by the Industrial Revolution\n2. **Dexterity** — increasingly automated by modern robotics\n3. **Cognition** — now being automated by AI and large language models\n4. **Empathy** — the last frontier, where human connection remains irreplaceable (for now)\n\nOnce machines are better, faster, cheaper, and safer than humans at any given economically valuable activity, it becomes economically irrelevant to hire a human for that job. This isn't ideology — it's market mechanics.\n\n### What History Tells Us\n\nHistory shows that automation *always* creates more total wealth. But it doesn't automatically distribute that wealth fairly. The Agricultural Revolution created agricultural barons. The Industrial Revolution created industrial magnates. Each transition concentrated wealth among those who owned the machines.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will create abundance. It's whether that abundance will be shared.\n\nThat's why Post-Labor Economics exists: not to prevent automation, but to ensure the transition benefits everyone. The policy interventions, ownership structures, and governance innovations we develop now will determine whether the AI revolution produces shared prosperity or unprecedented inequality.\n\n---\n\n*This article is part of the PLE Foundations series, exploring the core framework of Post-Labor Economics as developed by David Shapiro.*"

      "excerpt": "How do we shore up household income after jobs go away? The Pyramid of Prosperity organizes proven interventions into a layered framework — from universal guarantees to individual investment.",
      "body": "## Beyond Wages: Building Layered Income for Everyone\n\nThe central question of Post-Labor Economics is deceptively simple: **how do people sustain income when machines do most of the work?**\n\nDavid Shapiro's Pyramid of Prosperity provides an answer. Not through a single silver-bullet policy, but through a *layered system* of income sources that work together — much like Maslow's hierarchy provides a framework for understanding human needs at multiple levels.\n\n### The Five Layers\n\nImagine the Pyramid of Prosperity as a nutritional guide for economic health. Foundational elements sustain life, while higher tiers enhance vitality.\n\n#### Layer 1: Universals\n\nThe broadest base. Universal Basic Income, Universal Healthcare, Universal Basic Services. These provide an unconditional floor of prosperity for every citizen — no means testing, no bureaucratic gatekeeping.\n\nReal-world proof: Finland's UBI experiment demonstrated improved wellbeing. Catalonia's income trials showed reduced poverty with sustained growth. The Alaska Permanent Fund has distributed oil dividends to every resident for decades.\n\n#### Layer 2: Collectively Owned Public Assets\n\nSovereign wealth funds, land value taxes, and publicly owned infrastructure. The idea is simple: resources that belong to everyone should generate returns for everyone.\n\nNorway's Government Pension Fund holds over $1.5 trillion in assets managed on behalf of its citizens. Singapore's sovereign wealth funds generate returns that fund public services. These aren't theoretical — they're operational at national scale.\n\n#### Layer 3: Collectively Owned Private Assets\n\nCooperatives, community enterprises, employee-owned businesses, and DAOs. This layer democratizes enterprise itself.\n\nThe Mondragon Corporation in Spain employs 80,000+ people as a worker cooperative. Germany's *Mittelstand* — family-owned mid-sized enterprises — forms the backbone of Europe's largest economy. Community land trusts in the UK and US provide permanent affordable housing.\n\n#### Layer 4: Individual Private Assets\n\nStocks, bonds, businesses, rental properties. This doesn't change from today's capitalism — except that *everyone* participates meaningfully. As Shapiro puts it: \"Your 'job' in the future is to be an investor.\"\n\nThe lower layers of the Pyramid generate the capital that enables universal participation in private markets. Employee stock ownership plans, micro-investing platforms, and index fund democratization are already moving in this direction.\n\n#### Layer 5: Residual Wages\n\nWork persists in niches where human traits remain irreplaceable — empathy-based caregiving, creative arts, human connection. But these comprise a shrinking portion of future earnings, perhaps 20%.\n\n### Why This Works\n\nThe beauty of the Pyramid is its compatibility with market dynamics. It maintains price signals by rewarding investment and effort in the upper strata, yet ensures no one falls through cracks at the foundation.\n\nDiversified income sources buffer shocks — much like portfolio theory in finance. If one layer underperforms, others compensate. The system is resilient by design.\n\nCritically, this isn't a radical departure from capitalism. It's an *evolution* that broadens capital ownership to include everyone. As Shapiro argues: \"AI, automation, and robotics don't break capitalism — they force us to double down on it.\"\n\n### Getting There From Here\n\nEvery layer of the Pyramid has real-world precedent. The path from here to there is incremental, measurable, and testable. No revolution required — just determined, evidence-based policy-making.\n\n---\n\n*This article is part of the PLE Frameworks series, explaining the core models of Post-Labor Economics.*"

      "excerpt": "If labor power erodes, civic equilibrium collapses. The Pyramid of Power builds democratic resilience through stacked innovations — from immutable rights to forkable governance.",
      "body": "## When Workers Lose Leverage, Democracy Needs New Foundations\n\nThe social contract underlying modern democracy rests on a negotiation: workers provide labor, and in exchange they receive wages, rights, and political voice. Employers need workers, so workers have leverage. This leverage is the hidden engine of democratic stability.\n\nBut what happens when employers no longer need workers?\n\n### The Power Crisis\n\nAs automation erodes the demand for human labor, it simultaneously erodes the *bargaining power* that sustains democratic governance. If capital no longer needs labor, the implicit threat of a general strike — the ultimate democratic check — becomes meaningless.\n\nThis isn't a distant theoretical concern. Union membership has been declining for decades. Gig work has atomized collective bargaining. AI threatens to accelerate both trends exponentially.\n\nDavid Shapiro's Pyramid of Power addresses this directly: if the old sources of democratic leverage are disappearing, we need to build new ones.\n\n### The Five Layers of Civic Resilience\n\n#### Layer 1: Immutable Civic Bedrock\n\nFundamental rights that *cannot* be removed by any government, corporation, or algorithmic system. This is the constitutional foundation — but upgraded for the AI age. Rights to privacy, economic participation, information access, and algorithmic transparency become as fundamental as free speech and due process.\n\n#### Layer 2: Freedom to Transact\n\nThe practical ability to engage in economic activity without gatekeepers. Legal frameworks modernized for AI-speed transactions while protecting human agency. No citizen should be locked out of economic participation by algorithmic discrimination or corporate monopoly.\n\n#### Layer 3: Radical Transparency\n\nReal-time, machine-readable disclosure of all market-relevant information — and of governmental activity. If every transaction and decision is transparent, corruption and rent-seeking become far more difficult. This layer creates the informational infrastructure for genuine accountability.\n\n#### Layer 4: Direct Programmable Democracy\n\nLiquid democracy — where citizens can vote directly on issues or delegate their vote to trusted representatives on a topic-by-topic basis. Programmable voting enabled by secure technology. This isn't mob rule; it's granular democratic participation that reflects actual citizen preferences.\n\n#### Layer 5: Forkable Constitutional Meta-Governance\n\nThe most radical layer: the ability for communities to \"fork\" governance structures and experiment with new models. Just as open-source software allows anyone to fork a codebase and try a different approach, forkable governance allows democratic experimentation.\n\nIf your city wants to try a different tax structure or democratic model, the framework allows it — with built-in measurement and comparison.\n\n### Why Both Pyramids Are Needed\n\nThe Pyramid of Prosperity solves the income problem: how do people sustain themselves without wages? The Pyramid of Power solves the *agency* problem: how do people maintain democratic leverage without labor power?\n\nNeither works without the other. Prosperity without power creates comfortable subjects. Power without prosperity creates angry mobs. Together, they form the foundation of a functional post-labor society.\n\n### The Stakes\n\nIf labor power erodes without replacement, the civic equilibrium collapses. History shows what happens when large populations lose economic agency: social unrest, authoritarianism, and civilizational decline.\n\nThe Pyramid of Power is an insurance policy against that outcome — built from proven components, assembled into a coherent framework for democratic resilience.\n\n---\n\n*This article is part of the PLE Frameworks series, explaining the core models of Post-Labor Economics.*"

      "body": "## If Machines Do the Work, What Do Humans Do?\n\nPost-Labor Economics (PLE) starts with a simple observation: technology is making human labor increasingly optional. Not in some distant science-fiction future, but *now* — incrementally, sector by sector, task by task.\n\nThis isn't inherently bad. In fact, it could be the greatest liberation in human history. But only if we prepare for it.\n\n### The Core Idea\n\nPLE is a framework for navigating the transition from an economy based on human labor to one based on automated production. It asks: if machines generate the wealth, how do we ensure everyone benefits?\n\nThe answer isn't a single policy. It's a system of interlocking solutions:\n\n- **Income replacement** through layered sources (the Pyramid of Prosperity)\n- **Democratic preservation** through new forms of civic power (the Pyramid of Power)\n- **Measurable implementation** through clear metrics and pilot programs\n- **Incremental transition** that evolves existing systems rather than replacing them\n\n### What PLE Is NOT\n\nPLE is not anti-work. It's pro-choice. People should be free to work on what matters to them — not forced into labor for survival.\n\nPLE is not just UBI. Universal Basic Income is one tool, but the framework encompasses robot taxes, sovereign wealth funds, cooperative ownership, shortened work weeks, universal basic services, and entirely new economic models.\n\nPLE is not anti-capitalist. It maintains market dynamics, price signals, and investment incentives. It broadens who gets to participate in capitalism, not who gets to destroy it.\n\nPLE is not partisan. The transition away from labor-dependent economics affects everyone regardless of political orientation.\n\n### Why Now?\n\nThree forces are converging:\n\n1. **AI can now automate cognitive work** — writing, analysis, coding, creative tasks. The last \"safe\" category of human labor is no longer safe.\n2. **Productivity and wages have decoupled** — since 1979, productivity rose 60% while wages rose only 16%. The gains flow to capital, not workers.\n3. **The social contract is fraying** — when the promise of \"work hard and prosper\" stops working, political instability follows.\n\n### How to Get Involved\n\nPLE is an open movement. You can contribute by:\n\n- Reading the foundational articles in this series\n- Joining discussions about specific policies and proposals\n- Contributing your expertise in economics, technology, governance, or any relevant field\n- Voting on proposals that shape the platform's direction\n- Simply spreading awareness that these questions need answers\n\nThe future of work is being decided now. The question is whether it will be decided *for* you or *by* you.\n\n---\n\n*Based on David Shapiro's Post-Labor Economics framework. Learn more at the PLE series page.*"

      "body": "## The Deal That Built Modern Society\n\nEvery stable society rests on a social contract — an implicit agreement between the governed and those who govern. In the post-war Western world, that contract looked roughly like this:\n\n- **Workers** provide productive labor\n- **Employers** provide wages, benefits, and stability\n- **Government** provides infrastructure, regulation, and safety nets\n- **Everyone** benefits from rising prosperity\n\nThis arrangement produced the greatest period of shared prosperity in human history. The middle class expanded. Living standards rose. Democracy stabilized.\n\nBut the contract had a hidden dependency: it only works when labor has *leverage*.\n\n### The Leverage Problem\n\nWhen employers need workers, workers can negotiate. They can strike. They can vote for pro-labor policies. They can demand better conditions. This leverage is the invisible architecture of democratic capitalism.\n\nNeoliberal policies have been eroding this leverage for decades: weakening unions, normalizing gig work, offshoring manufacturing, and prioritizing shareholder returns over worker welfare. The Great Decoupling — where productivity rises while wages stagnate — is the measurable result.\n\nAI threatens to complete what neoliberalism started. If employers genuinely don't need human workers, the entire basis for labor's bargaining power disappears.\n\n### What Happens When the Contract Breaks\n\nHistory is clear on this point. When large populations lose economic agency, the results include:\n\n- **Political radicalization** — people turn to extremist leaders who promise restoration\n- **Social unrest** — from the French Revolution to the Arab Spring, economic dispossession drives instability\n- **Democratic erosion** — authoritarian governments offer order in exchange for freedom\n- **Civilizational decline** — societies that can't manage transitions eventually collapse\n\nWe're already seeing early signals: rising populism, declining trust in institutions, widening inequality, and increasing social fragmentation.\n\n### The Window of Opportunity\n\nThe good news: we're still in the early stages of the transition. AI hasn't fully replaced human cognitive labor yet. There's still time to build new frameworks.\n\nBut the window is narrowing. Every year that passes without proactive policy makes the eventual adjustment harder and more disruptive.\n\nPost-Labor Economics isn't about predicting doom. It's about preventing it — by building the income structures, governance innovations, and social adaptations that will sustain prosperity and democracy through the transition.\n\nThe social contract needs to be rewritten. The question is whether we'll rewrite it thoughtfully, through democratic deliberation, or whether it will be rewritten for us by crisis.\n\n---\n\n*This article is part of the PLE Context series, examining the forces driving the need for post-labor policy.*"

      "body": "## These Aren't Ideas. They're Operating Systems.\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of the Post-Labor Economics framework is that it doesn't require inventing anything new. Every layer of the Pyramid of Prosperity has working examples somewhere in the world. The challenge isn't proving these approaches work — it's combining and scaling them.\n\n### Universal Income: Already Tested\n\n**Alaska Permanent Fund** — Since 1982, every Alaska resident has received an annual dividend from the state's oil wealth fund. It's not enough to live on alone, but it demonstrates the mechanics of universal income distribution at scale.\n\n**Finland's UBI Experiment (2017-2018)** — Two thousand unemployed Finns received €560/month with no conditions. Results: improved wellbeing, slight increase in employment, and no evidence of the \"laziness\" critics predicted.\n\n**Stockton SEED Program** — Five hundred residents of Stockton, California received $500/month for two years. Full-time employment *increased* among recipients, from 28% to 40%.\n\n### Sovereign Wealth: Already Operating\n\n**Norway's Government Pension Fund** — Worth over $1.5 trillion, it's the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. It owns roughly 1.5% of all publicly listed companies globally, generating returns that fund Norwegian public services.\n\n**Singapore's GIC and Temasek** — Two sovereign wealth funds managing hundreds of billions, demonstrating that national-scale investment management is not only possible but profitable.\n\nThese funds prove that collective asset ownership can generate meaningful returns for citizens without distorting markets.\n\n### Democratic Enterprise: Already Scaling\n\n**Mondragon Corporation** — Based in the Basque Country of Spain, Mondragon is a federation of cooperatives with 80,000+ worker-owners. It's the tenth-largest Spanish company by revenue and the largest business group in the Basque Country. Workers vote on management, share profits, and have a direct stake in the enterprise.\n\n**German *Mittelstand*** — While not cooperatives, Germany's family-owned mid-sized enterprises demonstrate that distributed ownership (as opposed to Wall Street-style shareholder capitalism) can sustain economic competitiveness at a national level.\n\n**Community Land Trusts** — Operating in the US and UK, CLTs hold land in permanent community ownership, providing affordable housing and preventing speculative price inflation.\n\n### The Pattern\n\nIn every case, the same pattern emerges: broadening ownership creates stability, reduces inequality, and sustains economic dynamism. The PLE framework doesn't ask \"can this work?\" — it asks \"how do we combine what already works into a coherent system?\"\n\n### What's Missing\n\nThe missing piece isn't any individual policy — it's the *integration*. No country has yet assembled all five layers of the Pyramid of Prosperity into a coherent national strategy. That's the work ahead of us.\n\n---\n\n*This article is part of the PLE Evidence series, documenting real-world implementations of post-labor policies.*"

      "excerpt": "Any economic framework must be testable and falsifiable. Here are the measurements that track the great decoupling — and the indicators that will tell us if interventions are working.",
      "body": "## You Can't Fix What You Can't See\n\nDavid Shapiro insists that Post-Labor Economics must be measurable and falsifiable. If your body temperature is 104°F, you know you have a fever. Good economic metrics should work the same way — both descriptive (what's happening) and prescriptive (what to do about it).\n\n### Tracking the Great Decoupling\n\nThe most important metrics measure the growing divergence between productivity and prosperity:\n\n**Labor Share of Income** — What percentage of GDP goes to workers versus capital owners? This has been declining across all developed economies since the 1980s. If automation accelerates the decline, interventions are needed. If PLE policies stabilize or reverse it, they're working.\n\n**Productivity-Wage Gap** — The ratio between productivity growth and median wage growth. In the US, productivity grew 60% since 1979 while wages grew only 16%. This gap is the single clearest signal that the old social contract is breaking.\n\n**Automation Displacement Rate** — How quickly are tasks being automated? Not just \"how many jobs are lost\" (which misses the nuance) but \"what percentage of economically valuable tasks can machines now perform better and cheaper than humans?\"\n\n### Measuring Ownership Breadth\n\nThe Pyramid of Prosperity's effectiveness depends on broadening capital ownership:\n\n**Asset Ownership Distribution** — What percentage of the population owns productive assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, business equity)? Currently, the top 10% of Americans own 93% of stocks. PLE aims to flatten this.\n\n**Universal Income Coverage** — What percentage of citizens receive some form of non-labor income (dividends, UBI, sovereign fund distributions)?\n\n**Cooperative and Shared-Ownership Employment** — What percentage of workers are employed by cooperatives, employee-owned enterprises, or community-owned businesses?\n\n### Measuring Democratic Resilience\n\n**Voter Participation Rates** — Higher participation generally indicates a healthier democracy.\n\n**Policy Responsiveness** — How well do government policies reflect citizen preferences? Research shows this correlation has weakened significantly in the US.\n\n**Transparency Indices** — How accessible is government and corporate decision-making? Can citizens track how their representatives vote, how public funds are spent, how algorithms affect their lives?\n\n### The Dashboard Approach\n\nNo single metric tells the whole story. PLE proposes a dashboard of interlocking indicators — similar to how a doctor monitors multiple vital signs, not just temperature.\n\nThe power of this approach is accountability. If a PLE intervention is implemented and the metrics don't improve, the intervention needs revision. If metrics show improvement, we scale up.\n\nThis is what separates PLE from utopian hand-waving: everything is testable, everything is measurable, and everything is accountable to real-world outcomes.\n\n---\n\n*This article is part of the PLE Methodology series, covering the analytical tools of Post-Labor Economics.*"
